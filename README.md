# ANERcorp-Correction
This repository contains a different annotation of the ANERcorp from the original one. The main purpose is to correct the obvious flaws and to state our criteria for annotating ambiguous entities. The repository contains also the ANERcorp cascaded with word features from Madamira tool, which was used in a reseach paper titled: Enhancing Deep Learning with Embedded Features for Arabic Named Entity Recognition.
Files in this repository are not in the final version yet.
